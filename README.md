On the homepage, I included links to three dashboard pages. Additionally, I highlighted five key performance indicators (KPIs) related to total purchase quantity and amount, total sales quantity and amount, and closing stock quantity. Towards the bottom of the page, I implemented a scrolling section displaying the names of closing stock items along with their respective quantities.
